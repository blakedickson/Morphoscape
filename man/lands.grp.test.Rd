\title{
Significance tests between sets of weights
}
\description{
\code{lands.grp.test()} performs a statistical test that tests whether the optimal adaptive landscape for two subgroups are different from each other. The p-value of the test is the proportion of sets of weights among the best sets of weights that are shared between the two subgroups. \code{multi.lands.grp.test()} performs this test for all pairs of subgroups.
}
\usage{
lands.grp.test(grpa, grpb, method = "chi-squared",
               quantile = 0.05)

multi.lands.grp.test(x, method = "chi-squared",
                     quantile = 0.05)

\method{print}{lands.grp.test}(x, digits = max(3L, getOption("digits") - 3L), ...)

\method{print}{multi.lands.grp.test}(x, digits = max(3L, getOption("digits") - 3L), 
      style = "matrix", ...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{grpa, grpb}{
for \code{lands.grp.test()}, the two \code{grp_Wprime} objects containing the adaptive landscapes to be compared; these are the output of calls to \code{\link{calcGrpWprime}}.
}
  \item{x}{
for \code{multi.lands.grp.test()}, a \code{by_Wprime} object, the output of a call to \code{\link{calcWprimeBy}}.

for \code{print()}, the output of a call to \code{lands.grp.test()} or \code{multi.lands.grp.test()}.
}
  \item{method}{
the method used to determine which sets of weights are in the "best" sets of weights that are to be comapred between the two groups. Allowable options include \code{"chi-squared"} and \code{"quantile"}. See \code{\link{calcGrpWprime}} for details.
}
  \item{quantile}{
the top quantile used to determine the best sets of weights to be included in the average to compute the optimal set of weights. Should be a number between 0 and 1, with a low value indicating that only the few top sets of weights will be used. See \code{\link{calcGrpWprime}} for details.
}
  \item{digits}{
the number of significant digits to print.
}
  \item{style}{
how to display the results of the pairwise tests; allowable options include \code{"matrix"} and \code{"table"}. Abbreviations allowed.
}
  \item{\dots}{
passed to \code{\link{print.default}}.
}

\value{
For \code{lands.grp.test()}, a \code{lands.grp.test} object containing the following components:
\item{n.match}{the number of sets of weights that match between the two supplied subgroups}
\item{p.val}{the p-value of the test, compouted as the number of sets of weights that match divided by the number of sets of weights compared}
\item{matching}{a matrix containing the sets of weights that match between the two subgroups}
\item{method}{the argument supplied to \code{method}}
\item{quantile}{the argument supplied to \code{quantile}}

For \code{multi.lands.grp.test()}, a \code{multi.lands.grp.test} object containing the following components:
\item{res}{a data frame containing the results of the tests, with the columns \code{Group A} and \code{Group B} indicating the groups involved in the comparison, the column \code{Matches} containing the number of matching sets of weights in the comparison, and the column \code{p value} containing the p-value of the test.}
\item{method}{the argument supplied to \code{method}}
\item{quantile}{the argument supplied to \code{quantile}}

For \code{print.multi.lands.grp.test()}, setting \code{style = "table"} prints the \code{res} component as-is; setting \code{style = "matrix"} creates a matrix where the p-values of the test are below the diagonal and the number of matches of the test are above the diagonal.
