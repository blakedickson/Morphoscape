\title{
Calculate a single weighted adaptive landscape
}
\description{
\code{calc_lncp()} calculates a single weighted landscape from a set of kriged surfaces of functional characteristics and a set of weights for those characteristics. This landscape can then be plotted using \code{\link{plot.wtd_lscp}}. Additionally computes the fitness values for a sample of additional coordinates.
}
\usage{
calc_lscp(kr_data, weights)
}
\arguments{
  \item{kr_data}{
a \code{kriged_surfaces} object; the output of a call to \code{\link{krige_surf}}. If no \code{new_data} component is included in \code{kr_data}, only the adaptive landscape will be produced.
}
  \item{weights}{
a vector of weights, one for each functional characteristic. These weights should be nonnegative and sum to 1.
}
}
\details{
\code{calc_lncp()} operates on the kriged surfaces stored in \code{kr_data} by multiplying the functional characteristic values of each point on the surface grid by the weights and computing the sum of those values to arrive at a fitness value that is represented by the height of the adaptive landscape. When a \code{new_data} component is present in \code{kr_data} (e.g., because a \code{new_data} argument was supplied to \code{krige_surf()} or \code{kr_data} is the output of a call to \code{krige_new_data()}), the weighted fitness values will be computed for the coordinates in \code{new_data} as well.
}
\value{
A \code{wtd_lscp} object, which contains the following components:
\item{W}{a named vector of the supplied weights}
\item{Wprime}{a list containing the weighted \code{grid} and \code{new_data} components of \code{kr_data}, where the values of the functional characteristics for each location on the surface are weighted by the supplied weights and an additiona column, \code{Z}, has been added containing the height of the adaptive landscape at that point.}
}

\seealso{
\code{\link{plot.wtd_lscp}} for plotting the resulting weighted landscape.

\code{\link{generate_weights}} for generating a matrix of weights.

\code{\link{calc_all_lscps}} for computing weighted landscapes for a matrix of weights (i.e., rather than the single set of weights that can be used with \code{calc_lscp}). For finding an optimal set of weights, \code{calc_all_lscps} should be used.
