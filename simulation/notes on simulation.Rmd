# testing performance of adaptive landscapes methods
- set up "truth" simulated data
  - take a set of traits and make two adaptive landscapes.
  - generate populations that fit each adaptive peak with a degree of variation that fits the topology

- set up "sample" data
  - create sample data by perturbing both traits and points by adding noise.
    - can adjust how much each are perturbed to test to robustness of methods

- fit new adaptive landscapes
  - using group mean
  - using group sums
  - using sums weighted by distance to the mean
  - using sums weighted 95% conf elipse
  - using sums only within XX% conf elipse
  
- compare differnces in peaks
- compare differnces in topologies
